#+TITLE:Org-logseq

Org-logseq supports to open [[https://github.com/logseq/logseq][logseq]]-style link (page or block reference), transclusion of referred and embedded blocks using overlays, along with Org-Mode.

* Features

+ Open logseq-style links by native Org-Mode binding (=C-c C-o=, =Enter=, etc). Org-logseq supports:
  - Page link: =[[a logseq page]]=
  - Block reference: =((6064f6c6-440a-46ca-b8df-59131adab5a1))=
  - Block Embed and Reference overlays.
+ Create a blank excalidraw file if necessary, while inserting it at point.
+ Display logseq block references in buffer as overlays:
  - =((6064f6c6-440a-46ca-b8df-59131adab5a1))= to =[[id:6064f6c6-440a-46ca-b8df-59131adab5a1][Block heading]]=
  - ={{embed  ((6064f6c6-440a-46ca-b8df-59131adab5a1))}}= to the content of the referred block.
+ Download images stored in the logseq server to local.
  =curl= needs to be installed first.
+ Toggle =contents.org= as a sidebar.

* Installation

Org-logseq requires =grep=. Install it using your system tool at first. 

Org-logseq package is not on MELPA yet. Currently, the easiest way to install org-logseq is through [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]] or [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] system, or use the =:quelpa= or =:straight= keyword by using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]. In order to make =:quelpa= work well with =use-package=, you need to install [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]].

    :quelpa (org-logseq :fetcher github :repo "llcc/org-logseq" :files ("*"))

* Getting started

1. Set the variable =org-logseq-dir= to your logseq path.
2. =M-x org-logseq-mode= in your current buffer.
   Creating a directory-local varible in your logseq directory could be the best way to get it worked in all org files.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ((org-mode . ((eval org-logseq-mode 1))))
   #+end_src
   
3. Use your native Org-mode bindings to open pages or block references.
   
* Customization

- =org-logseq-create-page-p= ::
  A boolean value indicating whether or not org-logseq should try to new a page file at point if it does not exist. The varible defaults to =nil=.
- *org-logseq-block-ref-overlay-p* ::
  A boolean value indicating whether or not to display the overlays of =block references= when initializing the Org-Mode buffer. 
- *org-logseq-block-embed-overlay-p* ::
  A boolean value indicating whether or not to display the overlays of =block embed= when initializing the Org-Mode buffer. 

  
* Changelog

** <2021-04-08 Thu>
- Add a =org-logseq-toggle-contents-sidebar= command, to toggle your =contents.org= as a sidebar.
- Fix path quote bug in macOS, [[https://github.com/llcc/org-logseq/issues/1][#issue1]]
